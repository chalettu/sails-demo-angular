# sails-demo-angular
This is a simple demo of the angular frontend that interacts with the sails-demo-api backend repo I built
The backend  can be found at https://github.com/chalettu/sails-demo

Install the required tools: `yo`, `gulp`, `bower`
```
npm install -g yo gulp bower
```

Install `generator-gulp-angular`:
```
npm install -g generator-gulp-angular
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo gulp-angular`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo gulp-angular [app-name]
```
